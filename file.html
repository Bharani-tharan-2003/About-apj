                    on 19 February launched the APJ Abdul Kalam Satellite Launch Vehicle Mission. his contribution to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the educational sector has been remarkable. He was the man behind India’s Agni and Prithvi missiles. Apart from that, Dr Kalam became the 11th President of India in 2002 and he was often seen interacting with students encouraging them to achieve their dreams.</li></p>
                <p><li>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam is known as the missile man of India because of his contribution to the
                    project of Missiles. The name of the two main projects of the missile which is launched by India,
                    which are named “Agni” and “Prithvi”</li></p>
                <p><li>. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was one of the leading scientists of
                    the ISRO, that is to say, the Indian Space Research Organisation, and also of DRDO, which
                    stands for Defence Research and Development Organisation. I</li></p>

                    <un>
                    <p><li>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 
                   1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space 
                   Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that
                   was both designed and produced in India.Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program
                   that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname 
                   “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, 
                   which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</li></p>
                   <p><li>From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific 
                    adviser (1999–2001)to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country’s 1998 
                    nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the 
                    tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he 
                     described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan 
                     called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for
                     economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.</li></p>
                   <p><li>In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.</li></p>
